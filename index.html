    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/me.png" alt="Me" width="300" height="300" align="right"/>
    <p>
      As a second-year Master’s student at Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Computational Science and Engineering, I thrive in environments where seeking opportunities to learn, collaborate, and communicate pushes the boundaries of computational science. With my home unit in Physics, I have developed a strong foundation in scientific computing, probability theory, and high-performance computing (HPC), all of which serve as critical tools in my research and academic pursuits. My current interests lie in the application of machine learning to scientific problems, as well as exploring particle-based simulations to model physical systems more effectively. Through projects and research, I aim to contribute to innovations in scientific modeling, data-driven discovery, and simulation-based optimization.
