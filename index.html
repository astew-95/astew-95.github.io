  <section id="about">
    <h3>I am a computational science graduate student passionate about applying model-informed machine learning to real-world problems in science and mathematics.</h3>
  <p> Hi!</p>

<p>My name is Alexa and I am a recent graduate in Computational Science with an undergraduate degree in physics from MIT.  I come from a family of New England scientistsâ€“ my dad was a biology major and my mom is a STEM teacher, both of whom fostered a love of science in me at a young age. I explored a variety of courses in my undergraduate studies before switching to physics as my primary major, courses in the fields of both Chemistry/Chemical Engineering and Computer science fields. To my slgiht dismay, I did not take enough to be awarded a minor in Computer Science (I was one course short).  I was fascinated with the possibility of harnessing compute to advance science fields, and I felt that my interdisciplinary interest could not be conveyed in a single major. I decided on physics due to my intense curiosity for math, theory, and harnessing theoretical dynamics which underpin other fields. I fell in love with J-Lab, the research-intensive 12-unit physics course at MIT, one which many of my peers dreaded. In my free time I sing, compose, play piano, and read.</p>

<p>My interest in Machine Learning and computational techniques led me to pursue a masters in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. Serving as a teaching assistant, I taught physics courses and tutored students as well as participated in Georgia Tech's Chamber Chorus. </p>
